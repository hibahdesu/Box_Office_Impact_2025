# Box Office Impact 2025 (Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle)

After watching _Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle_, I was deeply moved by its storytelling, animation, and emotional weight. But beyond the cinematic brilliance, I wanted to understand its **global impact**—how it performed in theaters, how fans showed up, and how it stood among other major releases.

This dashboard is my tribute to that journey.

## 🔍 Why I Built This

Inspired by the movie’s intensity and visual style, I created a dashboard that blends **data analysis** with **anime-inspired design**. I wanted fans and analysts alike to explore how _Infinity Castle_ performed across months, theaters, and regions—while feeling the same cinematic energy that the movie delivered.

Using **GSAP animations**, I mirrored the transitions and pacing of the film, turning raw numbers into a scroll-driven experience that feels alive.
